# Lab 3 - Events (5 minutes)

### The goal of this lab is to learn how to make the computer react to a mouse click.  "Events" are actions that we want the computer to watch for, then respond to by running some code.

Keep your work from lab 2.

1.  From lab 2, your canvas should look like this:<br/>

2. Find the "When Clicked" shape under the *Events* commands and drag it to your canvas.  DO NOT connect it with any other shape<br/>

3. Find the "Play sound meow" shape under the *Sounds* commands and drag it to your canvas so that it connects to your first shape.<br/>

7. You're ready to run your program.  Click the your block of shapes.  While your Sprite is moving, click the flag icon again.  What happens? 

## If you have time

Try changing the background of your program, by clicking the "choose background" icon and selecting an image.

What happens?
