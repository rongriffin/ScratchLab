# Lab 2 - Loops (5 minutes)

### The goal of this lab is to move our Sprite around on the canvas by telling the computer to REPEAT a command multiple times. Loops let us run the same sequence of code as many times as we want.

We'll start similar to Lab 1....

1.  Click this link to open Scratch and start a new canvas: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted" target="_blank">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted</a>

2. Find the "Move 10 Steps" shape under the *Motion* commands and drag it to your canvas.  Change the number from 10 to 100.  <br/>

3. Find the "Turn right 15 degrees" shape under the *Motion* commands and drag it to your canvas so it connects to your first shape.  Change the number 15 to 90. <br/>

4. Find the "wait 1 secs" shape under the *Control* commands and drag it to your canvas so that it connects to your previous shape.<br/>

5. Your canvas should look like this: <br/>

6. This time, select the "repeat 10" shape under the *Control* commands and drag it to your canvas.  Drag the shapes you built in steps 2-6 **inside** of the "repeat 10" shape.  Your canvas should look like this: <br/>

7. You're ready to run your program.  Click the your block of shapes.  What happens?  How is this different than lab 1?

## If you have time

Try changing the "repeat 10" shape to a "forever" shape.

What happens?
